FILES (all paths are relative to the project working directory:

./UCI HAR Dataset

activity_labels.txt
Relates integer activity code to text description of activity.  6 rows x 2 columns
features_info.txt
Dataset documentation describing features.
features.txt
A listing of feature names corresponding to columns in the 'X_train.txt' and 'X_test.txt' files.  561 rows x 2 columns (index and data)
README.txt
Dataset documentation describing the experiment.

	./UCI HAR Dataset/test

subject_test.txt
List of subjects.  Assumption: these rows align with the data rows in 'X_test.txt'.  2947 rows x 1 column
X_test.txt
Table of data, 2947 rows  y 561 columns
y_test.txt
Assumption:  These are the activity codes aligned with the subject and data tables.  2947 rows x 1 column.

	./UCI HAR Dataset/train

subject_train.txt
List of subjects.  Assumption: these rows align with the data rows in 'X_train.txt'.  7352 rows x 1 column
X_train.txt
Table of data, 7352 rows  y 561 columns
y_train.txt
Assumption:  These are the activity codes aligned with the subject and data tables.  7352 rows x 1 column.

	./UCI HAR Dataset/test/Inertial Signals  and
	./UCI HAR Dataset/train/Inertial Signals

These are raw data sensor inputs.  They are not needed for this analysis.


DATASETS
	See ReadMe.txt for information on the 'Step's used in the analysis.
	
	Results:

all_data
Results of analysis.  Gives the value for all data variables (features). 10299 rows x 89 columns.  Columns are named for each variable.  Activity codes are followed by a text description.  This data frame is obtained by merging the 'all_train' and 'all_test' data frames which have common column names but unique “id” values.
all_subact_MeanValues
Gives the mean (average) value for all variables for each unique set of subject and activity.  180 rows x 87 columns.  The column names for the data are the names of the original data though the values are the mean for the corresponding variables.

	Steps 1 and 2
data_subject_train
data_y_train
data_X_train
These data frames are created from the data files.  An index is added, as “id”, sequenced 1 : 7352 (the number of rows in the data set)
data_subject_test
data_y_test
data_X_test
These data frames are created from the data files.  An index is added, as “id”, sequenced 7353 : 10299 (starting 1 above the “id” for the 'train' data sets; to the number of rows in both 'train' and 'test' data sets).  Having unique “id” values allows the combined data sets to be merged for the final results.
all_train
all_test
The data sets 'subject', 'y' and 'X' are merged to form combined data sets.  Data alignment is maintained by common “id” values.
select_Data
This numeric vector is obtained manually from the 'features.txt' file noting the variables that are 'mean' or 'std' values.  Length: 85
data_feature_names
This data set is created from the 'features.txt' file.  Column names are added.  It is assumed to be aligned with the columns of the data tables, 'data_X_train' and 'data_X_test'.
numTrainRec
numTestRec 
These constant numeric variables hold the number of rows in the 'train' and 'test' data sets respectively.  They are used to set the sequence limits for the “id” values.
select_X_train
select_X_test
These data frames are created from 'data_X_train' and 'data_X_test' including only the columns given in the select_Data vector.

	Step 3
subact_data
Used in loops to hold specific subject/activity data.
subact_Analysis
Used in loops to hold mean values for each variable.
